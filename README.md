# Predicting NIBM Diploma Studentsâ€™ GPA

## Introduction
This project aims to utilize the capabilities of machine learning to predict the outcomes of 
diploma students. It focuses on two aspects; classifying students, as pass or fail and 
predicting their GPA. To accomplish this data from the NIBM Learning Management System 
(LMS) and a dedicated GPA calculator is used. The project utilizes a decision tree model for 
pass/fail classification and a linear regression model for GPA prediction.
The pass/fail prediction model demonstrates promising accuracy, with 77.78%, which shows 
its potential in identifying students at risk on. On the hand the GPA prediction model achieves 
accuracy using linear regression with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of around 0.19 an 
R squared (R2) score of 0.97 and an Explained Variance Score of 97.49%.

## Data
The data used for this project is collected from the NIBM LMS and NotifIBM. The data from the LMS is used to train the pass/fail prediction model and the data from NotifIBM is used to train the GPA prediction model. 

## Methodology
1. Decision Tree Approach for Pass/Fail Prediction
2. Linear Regression Approach for GPA Prediction

## Results
### Pass/Fail Prediction Model:
The pass/fail prediction model, based on the decision tree algorithm, yielded an accuracy score of approximately 77.78%. This indicates that the model successfully classified pass and fail instances for diploma students with a commendable accuracy rate.

### GPA Prediction Model:
The GPA prediction model, utilizing linear regression, was assessed using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The calculated RMSE was approximately 0.19, signifying the average magnitude of the errors in GPA predictions. A lower RMSE indicates a closer alignment between predicted and actual GPA values.
